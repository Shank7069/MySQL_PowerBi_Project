- Profit and Loss Metrics.
Example -  Gross Price = $30
				- Pre-Invoice-Deductions = $2 (This is by Yearly agreement between Atliq an Customers)
		   Net Invoice Sales = Gross Price-Pre-Invoice-Deductions = (30-2) = $28
				- Post-Invoice-Deductions = $3 (Promotional Offer, Placement fee, Performance rebate)
           Net Sales = Net Invoice Sales - Post-Invoice-Deductions = (28-3) = $25
				- COGS(Cost on Goods Sold (Manufacturing Cost,Freight,Other Cost) = $20
		   Gross Margin = Net Sales - COGS = (25-20) = $5
           Gross Margin % = Gross Margin/Net Sales = 20%
             - Ads and Promotion $2
			Net Profit = Gross Margin - Ads and Promotion =(5-2) = $3
            Net profit % = Net Profit/Net Sales = 12%

WE ARE USING USED_FUNCTION 'GET_FISCAL_YEAR(S.DATE)' TO GET FISCAL YEAR , AND THIS IS BEING USED @
MULTIPLE PLACES, IT TAKE EVERY DATE ,THEN CONVERT TO FISCAL YEAR FOR SO MANY RECORDS, HENCE COULD BE REASON FOR TIME
SO, WE COULD CREATE A LOOK UP TABLE DIM_DATE, WITH FISCAL YEAR ACROSS VARIOUS DATES, WHICH COULD BE JOINED INITALLY
AND BE USED FOR JOINING OTHER CONDITIONS ON FISCAL YEAR..

TABLE CREATED WITH COLUMNS,CALENDAR DATE, AS IN SALES TABLE, FISCAL YEAR WILL BE AN GENIRIC COLUMN WITH LOGIC TO RETURN FISCAL_YEAR.
DATA COULD BE ADDED BY CREATING AN EXCEL FILE WITH CALENDAR_DATE COLUMN WITH DATA AS IN SALES TABLE, IE,
2018-09-01,2018-10-01,2018-11-01,,, TILL 2024., FISCAL_YEAR COLUMN AS EMPTY, AND SAVWE AS CSV..
THEN IMPORT CSV TO DIM_DATE TABLE ON MYSQL..
